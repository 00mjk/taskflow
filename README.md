Taskflow helps you quickly write parallel and heterogeneous tasks programs in modern C++

# Why Taskflow?

Taskflow is faster, more expressive, and easier for drop-in integration
than many of existing task programming frameworks
in handling complex parallel workloads.

Taskflow lets you quickly implement task decomposition strategies
that incorporate both regular and irregular compute patterns,
together with an efficient *work-stealing* scheduler to optimize your multithreaded performance.

| :------------: | :-------------: |
| ![](image/static_graph.svg) | <img align="right" src="image/dynamic_graph.svg" width="100%"> |

Taskflow supports conditional tasking for you to make rapid control-flow decisions
across dependent tasks to implement cycles and conditions that were otherwise difficult to do
with existing tools.

| :-----------------: |

Taskflow is composable. You can create large parallel graphs through
composition of modular and reusable blocks that are easier to optimize
at an individual scope.

| :---------------: |

Taskflow supports heterogeneous tasking for you to
accelerate a wide range of scientific computing applications
by harnessing the power of CPU-GPU collaborative computing.

| [Concurrent CPU-GPU Tasking](#concurrent-cpu-gpu-tasking) |

Taskflow provides visualization and tooling needed for profiling Taskflow programs.

# Start Your First Taskflow Program

The following program (`simple.cpp`) creates four tasks 
`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, where `A` runs before `B` and `C`, and `D`
runs after `B` and `C`.
When `A` finishes, `B` and `C` can run in parallel.

<p align="center">
<img src="doxygen/images/simple.svg">
</p>

```cpp
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>  // Taskflow is header-only

int main(){
  
  tf::Executor executor;
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;

  auto [A, B, C, D] = taskflow.emplace(  // create 4 tasks
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; } 
  );                                  
                                      
  A.precede(B, C);  // A runs before B and C
  D.succeed(B, C);  // D runs after  B and C
                                      
  executor.run(taskflow).wait(); 

  return 0;
}
```

Taskflow is *header-only* and there is no wrangle with installation.
To compile the program, clone the Taskflow project and 
tell the compiler to include the [headers](./taskflow/).

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow.git  # clone it only once
~$ g++ -std=c++17 simple.cpp -I taskflow/taskflow -O2 -pthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC 
TaskB 
TaskD
```

Taskflow comes with a built-in profiler, 
[TFProf](https://taskflow.github.io/tfprof/), 
for you to profile and visualize taskflow programs
in an easy-to-use web-based interface.

![](doxygen/images/tfprof.png)

```bash
# run the program with the environment variable TF_ENABLE_PROFILER enabled
~$ TF_ENABLE_PROFILER=simple.json ./simple
~$ cat simple.json
