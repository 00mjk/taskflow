/** @mainpage Modern C++ Parallel Task Programming

%Taskflow helps you quickly write parallel and heterogeneous 
task programs with <i>high performance</i>
and simultaneous <i>high productivity</i>.
It is faster, more expressive, fewer lines of code, and easier for drop-in integration
than many of existing task programming frameworks.

@section StaticDynamicTasking Static and Dynamic Tasking

%Taskflow has a unified interface for both @em static tasking and @em dynamic tasking,
allowing users to quickly master our parallel task programming model in a natural idiom.

@section ConditionalTasking Conditional Tasking

%Taskflow supports conditional tasking for you to implement cyclic and 
dynamic control flows that are otherwise difficult to do 
with existing task programming frameworks.

@section ComposableTasking Composable Tasking

%Taskflow is composable. You can create large parallel graphs through
composition of modular and reusable blocks that are easier to optimize
at an individual scope.

@section HeterogeneousTasking Concurrent CPU-GPU Tasking

%Taskflow supports heterogeneous tasking for you to 
accelerate a wide range of scientific computing applications
by harnessing the power of CPU-GPU collaborative computing.

@section ASimpleFirstProgram Start Your First Taskflow Program

The following simple program (@c simple.cpp) creates four tasks 
@c A, @c B, @c C, and @c D, where @c A runs before @c B and @c C, and @c D
runs after @c B and @c C.

@dotfile images/simple.dot

@code{.cpp}
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>  // Taskflow is header-only

int main(){
  
  tf::Executor executor;
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;

  auto [A, B, C, D] = taskflow.emplace(
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },   //  task dependency graph
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },   // 
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },   //          +---+          
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; }    //    +---->| B |-----+   
  );                                     //    |     +---+     |
                                         //  +---+           +-v-+ 
  A.precede(B);  // A runs before B      //  | A |           | D | 
  A.precede(C);  // A runs before C      //  +---+           +-^-+ 
  B.precede(D);  // B runs before D      //    |     +---+     |    
  C.precede(D);  // C runs before D      //    +---->| C |-----+    
                                         //          +---+          
  executor.run(taskflow).wait();

  return 0;
}
@endcode

%Taskflow is *header-only* and there is no wrangle with installation.
To compile the program, clone the %Taskflow project and 
tell the compiler to include the headers under @c taskflow/.

@code{.sh}
~$ git clone https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow.git  # clone it only once
~$ g++ -std=c++17 simple.cpp -I taskflow/taskflow -O2 -pthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC 
TaskB 
TaskD
@endcode

The execution order of B and C might differ as they can run concurrently.

@section SupportedCompilers Supported Compilers

To use %Taskflow, you only need a compiler that supports C++17:
